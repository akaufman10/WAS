    "# Introduction to the Theory of WAS\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook discusses the concepts and ideas that you need to know to use WAS. \n",
    "Using WAS is discussed in the [Introduction to the Usage of WAS notebook](./Intro_Usage.ipynb).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## WAS is a Water Allocation System\n",
    "\n",
    "The Water Allocation System (WAS) uses information about water sources, infrastructure, demand for water, and cooperation plans to build a model of a water system.  **WAS is special because it determines where water _should_ be allocated in order to achieve the greatest (optimal) social beneits.**  WAS also calculates the value of each water source, piece of infrastructure, and trade agreement.  It is designed to facilitate peacebuilding via water sharing among Israel, Jordan, and Palestine.  By calculating the benefits of cooperation and showing policy makers the best options for water sharing and trading, WAS hopes to encourage peaceful cooperation between nations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the conditions that lead the greatist social benefits, (called the optimal condition), WAS uses economic theory to take all the information available and makes an equation that determines the benefit to society based on water allocation.  The total benefit to society is called _**social welfare**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Social\\ Welfare\\ =\\ function(Water\\ Model)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the user has chosen the specific inputs to be considered, WAS uses a mathematical algortihm to determine the solutions that maximize Social Welfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Social\\ Welfare{max}\\ =\\ function(Water\\ Model_{optimal}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The results tell the user how to optimally allocate water, as well as the value of each part of the model, such as water source, connection, treatment plant, trade agreement, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "_**It is vital to understand that WAS does not make Policy, it only serves as a tool to guide it.**_\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, WAS does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Calculates total social surplus](####WAS calculates social surplus)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Calcuclates market equilibrium for each market](####WAS calculates equilibrium)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculates optimal water allocation to each market to maximize social surplus\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the (shadow) values of infrastructre and other transportation projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of WAS\n",
    "  WAS can be used to discover:\n",
    " * The best places and ways for countries to buy and sell water with eachother\n",
    " * The net benefits for each contry if they buy and sell wate with eachother\n",
    " * The best places for countries to collaborate on building new infrastrucutre\n",
    " * The net benefits for each country if they collaborate to build infrastructure\n",
    " * The best way to allocate water that ensures sustainable usage of water\n",
    " \n",
    "and within each country:\n",
    " * Where new infrastrucute is needed\n",
    " * The most beneficial water projects\n",
    " * Whether the benefits of a project outweigh the costs\n",
    " * The effects of different social policies \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Fundamental Economic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "in order to understand WAS, it is necessary to understand the concepts in this section.  Users who are already familiar with these ideas may still find it beneficial to read this section because water markets operate differently from classic markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Measure the Value of Water in Economic Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "The economic value of water is determined by the buyer's willingness to pay for it.  In economics, if a buyer is willing to pay \\$2 for a gallon of water, the _value_ of that water is \\$2, even if the price is only \\$1.  _Economic value_ does not capture the _personal value_ of water to a person stranded in the desert.  To her, a gallon of water is more valuable than \\$2, and indeed, water can have high _pesonal or social value_ even when its not affordable.  WAS [provides a way](google.com) for users to account for the personal and social value of water of those in need.  It is important to do so when modeling low-income or refugee populations that need free or subsidized access to water.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most people in the economy, however, are able to afford some amount of water.  The important question is how much each people and institutions values that water.  Thus, for the purposes of calculating the benefits of water allocation WAS uses the concept of _economic value_ as described below.  We will call the _economic value of water_ in WAS the _value of water_. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of water is based on how much a user is willing to pay for water.  The vaue of water declines as more is used.  Each additional unit that is desired, or demanded, is less valuable then the last.  This makes sense: A household will be willing to pay more for its first units of water since they are essential for drinking and cooking.  Subsequent units of water needed for showing or cleaning are less important, and a household would be willing to pay less for them.  This means they are less valuable.  A household would be willing to pay even less for the last units of water needed to water the garden.  This water is the least valuable.  So, **if we know how much a household is willing to pay for water, we know the value of the water.**  You can use the slider below to see the welfare (benefits) for a household at different price levels."

The benefit is high for the first units, since the household would be willing to pay a lot for them.  The benefit is low for the last units, since the household pretty much has all of the water it needs.\n",

Since the price (P) represents the maximum society would be willing to pay, it represents the social value of the Qth unit of water.

To do so, we draw a line representing the cost of providing each quantity of water, called the **supply curve**.  The cost of water increases as more is used.

The supply curve has a strange shape - like stairs - becuase of the nature of water provision: building pumps and pipes is very expensive, but once they are built, it is virtually free to operate them.  Each step in the supply function represents a new pump or pipe that must be built to supply additional water when previous infrastructure cannot pump any more water.\n",

Moving a unit of water from Market 1 to Market 2 would increase the social welfare from the water, increasing the social welfare in the region.
